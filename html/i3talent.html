                      During my internship at Orbid, I had the oppurtunity to meet and talk with people performing different functions within an IT Consultancy. Which allowed me to get a better idea of what an IT'er respresents and what the requirements are for a good one.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      I was also allowed to attend meetings like the monthly business unit updates or company meetings. Which gave me a better insight of how all those people are connected.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      I also came to realise that, if you want something, you are the one that needs to make it happen. Because, people have their own agenda. Which might be entirely different from what yours. Meaning that, they might not always have time for you. Therefore, you need to create that time.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Finally, I learnt that every project I will work on, even if it doesn't reach its goals, has a business value. Furthermore, any project will also have a cost attributed to it. Both in time and money.

                      I went and visitted the Afstudeerbeurs at the ICC in Ghent. Because, I still feel like I have a lot to learn. Specifically, I would like to, in the long term, lead a small team of system engineers or an IT project.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Therefore, I went to the exchange to look up which Post-Graduates are available to me and talk to the teachers who will be giving them.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      I had also planned to attend a couple of speakers and sessions. However, due to some missmanaged of my time I did not see as many as I would have liked.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Finally, I did get another oppurtunity to talk with some other companies though. Some of which I might apply to after my internship.

                      I was interested in the IT-lab idea when it was first mentioned mid-2017. The idea for an IT labratory where students could exercise with real equipment and situation was exciting.
                      Furthermore, having it managed by students for students sounded like a cool extra-curriculum activity.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      However, I think the current situation is not ideal yet. We aren't fully utilizing its potential yet. Specifically for students following the System- and Network Management course.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Finally, in time, I believe this project might grow to fullfil everyone's needs.

                      As the additional course to follow, I chose for IP Project. I have to admit though, that the subject of this year, was out of my comfort zone. 'Smart cities' was definitely more orientated towards Development then System- and Network Management.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      However, that was not why I chose the course. I chose the course, because I had the oppurtunity to meet and talk with different people from different countries. And, that was exactly what I got. Fins, Dutchmen and Spaniards, there was quite a mix of different nationalities. I especially bonded with some of the local Fins and Dutch. I even met up with some of the Dutch not too long ago.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Finally, it wasn't like I didn't learn anything though. We saw some futuristic technologies, like: Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality and Building Information Model all working together.

                      GDPR was the first subject I had in mind for my bachelorthesis. However, I did not have a good Use Case in mind. Which is why I dropped it.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Nevertheless, I am still silently following the subject from a distance. In my opinion this is one of th&eacute; biggest steps for the law regarding IT. Its implimentation will be far reaching and involve the entire IT sector.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Finally, in my opinion, the lecture we got on GDPR was by far the most interesting. It would be good that in the future, we would get more lectures like that.

                      The Facebook-leaks of april 2018 seems to finally have awoken people to the fact that websites like Facebook aren't really social media websites. Their business model looks more like one of an advertisement company. I find it shocking that Facebook is being burned for this, but everyone is ignoring Google or LinkedIn.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      These companies in the past have abused their consumers data as well. However, they seemingly are allowed to get away with it. Because, people are still to content with the services they offer. This is something mindblowing for me.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      I have long given up the notion of privacy on the internet. Not that I am now an open book for it, with no password security. Nevertheless, trying to protect myself from data mining and such is a waste of effort.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Finally, I did request the information of me that Facebook is storing. It was limited and detailed at the same time. They appear to have quite a good image of me, however most of what they send is already up for grabs if we were friends.
