                                            Projects 2 consisted of a serie of 6 assignments which a future System- and networkadministrator might have to perform. However, to start this course we had to divide ourselves in groups of 4 people and sign-up to our online repository on GitHub.

                                            The first assignment was a set of network exercises. However, unlike previous exercises the focus was mainly on documenting how you accomplished the tasks.

                                            <br>
                                            Required creating 3 different webservers. The first was a Lampstack, next was a IIS-server and lastly was the JavaEEstack.

                                            This assignment was a sub-set of assignment &#35;2. For this assignment we had to prepare a CentOS 7-server with MariaDB, Firewalld and SELinux installed.

                                            For assignment &#35;3 they asked us to, theoretically, develop and expand the configuration of our own network lab. The deliverable for this assignment included a run down of the costs and chosen equipment.

                                            <br>
                                            Assignment &#35;4 was focused entirely on Docker. The teachers had us perform this assignment, because a lot of groups struggled with the IIS-server and its .NET-application.
                                            <br>

                                            The last assignment had develop either a MDT or SCCM-server. With this system you can push and update your Windows workstation. A handy service to have, however tough to deploy properly.

                                            For Projects 3 the class had to divide itself into Team Red or Green. Team Red would develop a network composed entirely of Windows servers. Team Green would do the same, but entirely composed of Linux servers.
                                            <br>
                                            After the teams were divided more or less evenly, we then had to create smaller groups who would focus on one of the following tasks:
                                            <br>
                                            Deploy one of the following servers:
                                        </p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <il>Active Directory with DNS</il>
                                            <il>Fallback AD with DNS</il>
                                            <il>Exchange server</il>
                                            <il>Mail server</il>
                                            <il>DHCP server</il>
                                            <il>File server</il>
                                            <il>Sharepoint</il>
                                            <il>Real-time montering server</il>
                                            <il>MSCS</il>
                                            <il>Sharepoint</il>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>
                                            Or, build the internal and external network connecting all of these devices.
                                            <br>
                                            Because, between these 2 seperate networks we would then have to develop a working connection over VPN.
                                            <br>
                                            Finally, at the end of the assignment, we had to deploy both the network and servers automatically using zero-touch installation software.

                                            My bachelorthesis compared the differences difference between Docker for Windows on a Windows Server 2016 and Docker CE on a CentOS 7.4.
                                            <br>
                                            Specifically, I used software testing to get concrete data on how well each device functions regarding performance and security.
                                            <br>
                                            To accomplish this, I'm using Vagrant to automatically and consistently deploy both servers again and again
                                            <br>
                                            As a conclusion I discovered that DevOps-teams best use Docker for Linux. Because, there is more documentation available for it and the performance is significantly better. However, Microsoft-minded companies and/or users with a Windows computer should make the transistion. Because, the ease of use is quite a bit higher.

                                            1. Automating the monitoring server. <br>

                                            I passed my certification of MS-900 in octobre of 2019.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            This has provided me with a solid graps in the basics of the Microsoft 365-suite.
                                            <br>
                                            I started my lessons by getting a grasp on the basics by listening to and reading several indepent- and Microsoft-related courses.
                                            <br>
                                            Afterwards, I created a Microsoft 365-tenant of my own in which I experimanted with some of the technologies that were available to me.
                                            <br>
                                            Finally, after revising and making sure I was ready, I went out and got myself certified.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            Now, topics regarding Azure AD, Office 365 and other related applications are no longer strange to me, especially from an operational point of view.
                                            <br>
                                            I'm keen to continue improving my skills regarding this topic by combining my operationals duties with further certification.

                                            I've recently bought a Raspberry PI 4 which I'm keen of turning into a lite-mediaplatform.

                                            So that I can, for example, connect to my Chromecast or TV to play any music or movies that I'd like.
                                            <br>
                                            I'm currently not sure yet which OS I'll be using.
                                            As it's still very much all still conceptual.

                                            Like stated previously, I'm keen on furthering my knowledge of Microsoft Cloud solution.
                                            <br>
                                            Thus the logical next step for me seems to be getting certified in AZ-900.
                                            <br>
                                            I'm interested in how much overlap there will be with what I've learnt before in MS-900.
                                            <br>
                                            However, for now I'm more focussed on first getting to know what the relevant topics are and sources to learn from.
