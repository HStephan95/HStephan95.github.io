                                            Projects 2 consisted of a serie of 6 assignments which a future System- and networkadministrator might have to perform. However, to start this course we had to divide ourselves in groups of 4 people and sign-up to our online repository on GitHub.

                                            The first assignment was a set of network exercises. However, unlike previous exercises the focus was mainly on documenting how you accomplished the tasks.

                                            <br>
                                            Required creating 3 different webservers. The first was a Lampstack, next was a IIS-server and lastly was the JavaEEstack.

                                            This assignment was a sub-set of assignment &#35;2. For this assignment we had to prepare a CentOS 7-server with MariaDB, Firewalld and SELinux installed.

                                            For assignment &#35;3 they asked us to, theoretically, develop and expand the configuration of our own network lab. The deliverable for this assignment included a run down of the costs and chosen equipment.

                                            <br>
                                            Assignment &#35;4 was focused entirely on Docker. The teachers had us perform this assignment, because a lot of groups struggled with the IIS-server and its .NET-application.
                                            <br>

                                            The last assignment had develop either a MDT or SCCM-server. With this system you can push and update your Windows workstation. A handy service to have, however tough to deploy properly.

                                            For Projects 3 the class had to divide itself into Team Red or Green. Team Red would develop a network composed entirely of Windows servers. Team Green would do the same, but entirely composed of Linux servers.
                                            <br>
                                            After the teams were divided more or less evenly, we then had to create smaller groups who would focus on one of the following tasks:
                                            <br>
                                            Deploy one of the following servers:
                                        </p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <il>Active Directory with DNS</il>
                                            <il>Fallback AD with DNS</il>
                                            <il>Exchange server</il>
                                            <il>Mail server</il>
                                            <il>DHCP server</il>
                                            <il>File server</il>
                                            <il>Sharepoint</il>
                                            <il>Real-time montering server</il>
                                            <il>MSCS</il>
                                            <il>Sharepoint</il>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>
                                            Or, build the internal and external network connecting all of these devices.
                                            <br>
                                            Because, between these 2 seperate networks we would then have to develop a working connection over VPN.
                                            <br>
                                            Finally, at the end of the assignment, we had to deploy both the network and servers automatically using zero-touch installation software.

                                            My bachelorthesis compared the differences difference between Docker for Windows on a Windows Server 2016 and Docker CE on a CentOS 7.4.
                                            <br>
                                            Specifically, I used software testing to get concrete data on how well each device functions regarding performance and security.
                                            <br>
                                            To accomplish this, I'm using Vagrant to automatically and consistently deploy both servers again and again
                                            <br>
                                            As a conclusion I discovered that DevOps-teams best use Docker for Linux. Because, there is more documentation available for it and the performance is significantly better. However, Microsoft-minded companies and/or users with a Windows computer should make the transistion. Because, the ease of use is quite a bit higher.

                                            My intership as main theme resolved around automation, specified in 3 assignment:

                                            1. Automating the monitoring server. <br>

                                            I passed my certification of MS-900 in octobre of 2019.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            This has provided me with a solid graps in the basics of the Microsoft 365-suite.
                                            <br>
                                            I started my lessons by getting a grasp on the basics by listening to and reading several indepent- and Microsoft-related courses.
                                            <br>
                                            Afterwards, I created a Microsoft 365-tenant of my own in which I experimanted with some of the technologies that were available to me.
                                            <br>
                                            Finally, after revising and making sure I was ready, I went out and got myself certified.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            Now, topics regarding Azure AD, Office 365 and other related applications are no longer strange to me, especially from an operational point of view.
                                            <br>
                                            I'm keen to continue improving my skills regarding this topic by combining my operationals duties with further certification.

                                            As I'm spending more and more time in Azure Devops, I've decided to skip the AZ-900 and go to AZ-104 exam.
