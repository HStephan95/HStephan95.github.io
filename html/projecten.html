                        Projects 2 consisted of a serie of 6 assignments which a future System- and networkadministrator might have to perform. However, to start this course we had to divide ourselves in groups of 4 people and sign-up to our online repository on GitHub.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Assignment &#35;1</strong>
                        <br>
                        The first assignment was a set of network exercises. However, unlike previous exercises the focus was mainly on documenting how you accomplished the tasks.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Assignment &#35;2</strong>
                        <br>
                        Required creating 3 different webservers. The first was a Lampstack, next was a IIS-server and lastly was the JavaEEstack.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Assignment &#35;2.5</strong>
                        <br>
                        This assignment was a sub-set of assignment &#35;2. For this assignment we had to prepare a CentOS 7-server with MariaDB, Firewalld and SELinux installed.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Assignment &#35;3</strong>
                        <br>
                        For assignment &#35;3 they asked us to, theoretically, develop and expand the configuration of our own network lab. The deliverable for this assignment included a run down of the costs and chosen equipment.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Assignment &#35;4</strong>
                        <br>
                        Assignment &#35;4 was focused entirely on Docker. The teachers had us perform this assignment, because a lot of groups struggled with the IIS-server and its .NET-application.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Assignment &#35;5</strong>
                        <br>
                        The last assignment had develop either a MDT or SCCM-server. With this system you can push and update your Windows workstation. A handy service to have, however tough to deploy properly.
                        <br>

                  <strong>Projects 3</strong>

                  <span>
                      <p>
                        For Projects 3 the class had to divide itself into Team Red or Green. Team Red would develop a network composed entirely of Windows servers. Team Green would do the same, but entirely composed of Linux servers.
                        <br>
                        After the teams were divided more or less evenly, we then had to create smaller groups who would focus on one of the following tasks:
                        <br>
                        Deploy one of the following servers:
                      </p>
                        <ul>
                          <il>Active Directory with DNS</il>
                          <il>Fallback AD with DNS</il>
                          <il>Exchange server</il>
                          <il>Mail server</il>
                          <il>DHCP server</il>
                          <il>File server</il>
                          <il>Sharepoint</il>
                          <il>Real-time montering server</il>
                          <il>MSCS</il>
                          <il>Sharepoint</il>
                        </ul>
                      <p>
                        Or, build the internal and external network connecting all of these devices.
                        <br>
                        Because, between these 2 seperate networks we would then have to develop a working connection over VPN.
                        <br>
                        Finally, at the end of the assignment, we had to deploy both the network and servers automatically using zero-touch installation software.

                        Currently, I'm still working on my bachelorthesis. As subject I chose to test the difference between Docker for Windows on a Windows Server 2016 and Docker CE on a CentOS 7.4.
                        <br>
                        Specifically, I'll be using software testing to get concrete data on how well each device functions regarding performance, integration and security.
                        <br>
                        To accomplish this, I'm using Vagrant to automatically and consistently deploy both servers again and again.

                        I'm also currently working at Orbid for my internship. So far, it has been a blast. Orbid is a very open company, which has offered me the oppurtunity to develop myself both on professional and personal level.
                        <br>
                        They also helped me in further solidifying in what I would like to do and accomplish in the future.

                        In the future, I'm going to deploy a small home-server. Which I'll use to deploy and test ideas that are running through my head. But, that I cannot do during my working hours.
                        <br>
                        I would also like to use it as a small media-server. It would allow me to have a central point to gather all my music and movies.
